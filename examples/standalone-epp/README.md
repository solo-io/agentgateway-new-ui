## Standalone EPP Example

This example shows the v1 static config shape for running `agentgateway` as the sidecar proxy next
to a [standalone EPP](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/standalone/) deployment
on Kubernetes.

### Config shape

```yaml
services:
- name: my-model
  namespace: default
  hostname: my-model
  vips: []
  ports:
    8000: 8000

binds:
- port: 8081
  listeners:
  - routes:
    - backends:
      - service:
          name: default/my-model
          port: 8000
        policies:
          inferenceRouting:
            endpointPicker:
              host: 127.0.0.1:9002
            destinationMode: passthrough
```

### What it does

* `agentgateway` listens on port `8081`.
* The top-level `services` entry defines the logical backend `Service`
  `default/my-model:8000`.
* Before choosing an upstream endpoint, `agentgateway` calls the local EPP over
  ext-proc at `127.0.0.1:9002`.
* EPP returns the selected backend `ip:port`, and `agentgateway` forwards
  directly to that destination without requiring matching local workload
  endpoint entries because `destinationMode` is set to `passthrough`.

### Current v1 constraints

* `inferenceRouting` is only supported on `service` route backends.
* Standalone routing requires a top-level logical `services` entry, but does
  not require matching top-level `workloads` endpoint discovery data.
* `destinationMode: passthrough` is required when EPP owns endpoint discovery.
  Without it, EPP-selected destinations must match agentgateway's local service
  endpoint data.
* Standalone local config is fail-closed for now. If EPP is unavailable, the
  request fails instead of falling back to direct service endpoint balancing.
* This example is meant to be mounted into the `agentgateway` sidecar in a
  Kubernetes deployment. It is a reference config, not a standalone local demo.
